# Tweeter Project

Tweeter is a simple, single-page Twitter clone.

I was able to take some starter code and build upon it to practice my HTML, CSS, JS, jQuery and AJAX front-end skills, and my Node, Express and MongoDB back-end skills. This was an oppurtunity to showcase problem solving skills and creativity.
